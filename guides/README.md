# Guides

Guides for working together, getting things done, programming well, and
programming in style.

## High level guidelines

- Be consistent.
- Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
- Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
- A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

## A note on the language

- "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
- "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
- "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
- "Use" is a positive instruction.
